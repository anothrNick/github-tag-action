- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers are responsible for removing, editing, or rejecting comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They may also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful behaviors.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and when an individual officially represents the community in public spaces. Representing our community includes:

- Using an official email address.
- Posting via an official social media account.
- Acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events.

## Enforcement

To report abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, don't hesitate to contact the community leaders responsible for enforcement by logging an issue or getting one or more of the maintainers directly.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated to the best of our capacity and ability.

Community leaders must respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
